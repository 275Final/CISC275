In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background. "

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death."

ANTH357,Climate Refugees and Environmental Displacement,3,No prerequisites.,"“Unprecedented” situations of environmental degradation and disaster are becoming increasingly regular as a result of climate change, which in turn makes many places uninhabitable and displaces thousands of people.

WOMS343,Motherhood and Contested Reproduction,3,No prerequisites.,"Reproduction is more contested than ever, and is both shaped by and shaping the diverse cultural backgrounds and beliefs of people everywhere. Reproduction is a topic and experience that cuts across multiple political and personal issues: it is at once a deeply intimate and highly public process with implications for both individuals and societies. In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background. "

WOMS354,Global Humanitarianism,3,No prerequisites.,"This course explores the politics, ethics, and dimensions of cultural diversity that are embedded in situations of global humanitarianism-but often ignored, through claims of the supposed ‘neutrality’ of humanitarian intervention. Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death."
